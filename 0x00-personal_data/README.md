# 0x00. Personal data

## A simple summary of thIS concepts:

1. **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):**
   PII is like private information about you, such as your name, phone number, and address. We keep it safe so only the right people can know it.

2. **Log Filter for PII:**
   A log filter is a tool that hides secret things, like changing a password into symbols, so even if someone sees it, they can't understand.

3. **Encrypting a Password:**
   Encrypting is like putting a password in a locked box. It keeps the password safe. To check if a password is right, we use a special key to unlock the box.

4. **Authenticating with Environment Variables:**
   Environment variables are like secret codes. Computers use them to prove they're allowed to use certain things, like a special clubhouse or a secret database.
